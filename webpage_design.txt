There should be a four different pages
The main page will have three buttons, each one an option that corresponds to a query type
When the user clicks on of the buttons, they will be taken to another page
On one page they will be able to enter an artists name, then some visualizations about their stats will load
On another they will be able to enter a song's name and get some visualizations for information
On the third page they will be able to enter an album's name and get some visualizations about it
There should be buttons to reset the pages so the user can enter new information and generate new visualizations
There should be navigation between the main page and the other pages
Finally, there could be one more page with some buttons to load some preset queries and visualizations
